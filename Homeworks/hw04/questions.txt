Homework 4, Activity 1:  Learning to use Valgrind

Name: Duc Phan - ddp3945@rit.edu

Instructions
------------

These questions deal with the movie program found in movie.c, mtime.c and
movietest.c.  Compile these files as indicated in the assignment writeup.

We have included a compiled copy of the solution "goodmovietest" for you
to run to see how the program should behave.

The nature of these activities will have you switching back and forth
between running valgrind and looking at code. You may find it helpful to
have a second shell window open; run valgrind in the first window, and
execute other commands (such as 'more', or an editor) in the second window.

Questions
---------

1. Run "movietest" and observe its behavior

   a. When movietest is run without valgrind, what error is reported?

******************** Your answer below (5 points) ********************
    This error is reported: double free or corruption (out)
***********************************************************


   b. Is the behavior of movietest consistent, if you run it multiple
      times (e.g. 5 times) does it result in the same error each time?
      Does ANYTHING change about the error?

******************** Your answer below (5 points) ********************
    The behavior is consistent, the same error occurs each time movietest is run.
    However, the memory address where the error occurred changes every time. This is
    a memory address in the heap.
***********************************************************


   c. Explain what a "double free or corruption" error message likely
      means. That is to say, when discussing dynamic memory management
      what does "double free" mean and why is it a problem?

******************** Your answer below (5 points) ********************
    This error occurred when there is a function call to free with a pointer to a memory
    region that has already been freed before. It is a problem because it causes unexpected behavior
    which the program may not be able to handle.
***********************************************************

2. Use gdb to begin to investigate the error

   a. Run movietest in gdb. Look at the backtrace (Hint: use the 'bt'
      command.) It should show several frames of C library files followed
      by 2 frames in the movietest application. Copy and paste the last
      two lines  of the backtrace here:



******************** Your answer below (5 points) ********************
    #6  0x0000000000400caa in movieDelete (m=0x6034d0) at movie.c:60
    #7  0x0000000000400b76 in main () at movietest.c:118
**********************************************************

   b. When the error occurs, what line of code was executing in
      movie.c?  Please give the line number and type the line completely.

******************** Your answer below (5 points) ********************
    Line 60 in movie.c was executing:
    free(m->director) ;
**********************************************************
   c. When the error occurs, what line of code was executing in
      movietest.c?  Please give the line number and type the line completely.

******************** Your answer below (5 points) ********************
    Line 118 in movietest.c was executing:
    movieDelete( movie3 ) ;
**********************************************************

   d. Select the stack frame pertaining to movie.c and then run the
      "list" command to examine the source code around the line of
      code where the error occurred. (Hint: use the 'frame' command.)
      Copy and paste the result of running list here:

******************** Your answer below (5 points) ********************
	(gdb) list
	55	// Name:        (destructor)
	56	//
	57	void movieDelete(movie *m)
	58	{
	59	    //director
	60	    free(m->director) ;
	61	    //title
	62	    free(m->title) ;
	63	    //time
	64	    if(NULL != m->lastPlayed)
**********************************************************

3. You will now return to looking at the output of valgrind.  If you
   saved the errors in a file, you may look at that file.  Otherwise,
   run the valgrind command from the writeup again on movietest.

   Find the "LEAK SUMMARY" information at the end of the valgrind output.


   a. How many bytes of memory are reported lost?

******************** Your answer below (5 points) ********************
    500 bytes of memory are reported lost.
***********************************************************

   b. Find the "HEAP SUMMARY" section of the valgrind output.
   How many bytes of memory are in use when the program exited?

******************** Your answer below (5 points) ********************
    500 bytes of memory are in use when the program exited.
***********************************************************

   c. Keep looking at the "HEAP SUMMARY".  How many allocation and
   deallocation calls were made?

******************** Your answer below (5 points) ********************
    60 allocs and 50 frees were made.
***********************************************************

4. The output from valgrind indicates many different errors, but most
   are caused by the same statements in the program being executed
   again and again.

   a. Look at all the different types of errors reported by valgrind.
      Notice that there are many invalid writes and invalid reads,
      and that each error lists the relevant stack frame information
      to find both where the error occurred and from where the
      nearby memory was allocated.

      What is the other type of error reported by valgrind for this program?

******************** Your answer below (5 points) ********************
    The other type of error is: Invalid free() / delete / delete[] / realloc()
***********************************************************


   b. Notice each of the reported errors include information leading to
   lines in the source file where malloc has been called (i.e., block
   allocations).   List all of the source lines where blocks are allocated:

******************** Your answer below (5 points) ********************
    movie.c line 41, 103, 105, 108, 148
***********************************************************

   c. At what lines in the source file are the invalid read and write
      accesses to the memory blocks occurring? List the relevant information
      for the first three invalid writes and the first three invalid reads.

      Here is a small part of a correct response:

            The first invalid read is at moive.c:79.

******************** Your answer below (5 points) ********************
    The first invalid write is at movie.c:106
    The second invalid write is at movie.c:106
    The third invalid write is at movie.c:109

    The first invalid read is at movie.c:79
    The second invalid read is at movie.c:80
    The third invalid read is at movie.c:71
***********************************************************

   d. Your task is to find the source of these errors.  You may wish
   to review the file "movie.h" -- especially the structure definition.
   You should also look at the source code around the offending lines.
   This question may require thinking and contemplation.

   What is the likely cause of the invalid read/write errors?

******************** Your answer below (5 points) ********************
    The error is caused in movie.c movieCopy function at line 105 and 108.
    The malloc call on these 2 lines are given the wrong parameter, result in a
    shorter buffer than needed. The sizeof call to m->director and m->title does not give
    the length of these C-string. It gives the size of a pointer to the string, which is 8 byte.
    This is the wrong size that the author intended to allocate. The size of the buffer to be
    allocated is supposed to be the length of the string + 1. The fix is to change sizeof to strlen.
***********************************************************

Given the knowledge gained from the previous question, correct these
errors and then recompile and retest the program.  The invalid memory
access errors should no longer occur.

5. Run valgrind again. Notice that after the program output valgrind
   reports two occurrences of "Invalid free()".

   a. In what function do these errors occur, and how many times is
      that function called from main()?

******************** Your answer below (5 points) ********************
    The error occurred in the movieDelete function. This function is called 6 times from main but
    only the one from line 117 causes the error.
***********************************************************

   b. How many times is free() called from inside that function itself
      (i.e., not from any other functions it calls)?

******************** Your answer below (5 points) ********************
    free() is called twice inside the function itself.
***********************************************************

   c. What fix is needed to eliminate the "Invalid free()" message?

******************** Your answer below (5 points) ********************
    This error is caused by the second free of movie1 on line 117. Since movie1
    has already been freed at line 105, removing the line 117 will fix this error.
***********************************************************

Make the fix you described, re-build and re-run the program.  The "Invalid
free" errors should no longer appear.

6. In the "HEAP SUMMARY" section, there are number of error reports
   regarding lost blocks of memory.

   a. In which functions were the calls to malloc() made which allocated
      the blocks that were lost, and what line numbers of what file?

******************** Your answer below (5 points) ********************
    - newMovie: movie.c:41
    - movieCopy: movie.c:103
    - movieToString: movie.c:148
***********************************************************

   b. Examine the code to determine what you need to change to fix each
      of the problems. Explain your solution.

******************** Your answer below (5 points) ********************

    For each of the memory allocation, the corresponding free of that memory needs to be called.
    The fix is to free a memory block after done using it or before assign something else to the pointer pointing
    to that memory block.
    The reason of this fix is that if a pointer to a memory block is assigned to something else before the memory is
    freed, chances are the memory block still exists when the program exits.
    In short, every allocated memory has to be freed correspondingly.
***********************************************************

   c. The memory allocated by these functions is returned by them to
      the calling function; this effectively transfers the responsiblity
      for deallocating the memory to the caller as well.  Where is the
      most logical place for this memory to be deallocated?

******************** Your answer below (5 points) ********************
    The most logical place for this memory to be deallocated is right after the code has done using it.
***********************************************************

Make the necessary changes to the code to correct these final errors.
At this point, if you did your work correctly, your program should run
to completion with no memory management errors detected by valgrind.
